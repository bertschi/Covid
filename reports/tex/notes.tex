  the global COVID-19 pandemic.

\section{Data exploration}

The John Hopkins university and other institutes publish daily numbers
of cases and death tolls. Here, we build on their data sets and
provide some simple explorations and modeling.

\subsection{Country comparison}

\fig{rawdata} shows the raw data for several countries \footnote{Here,
  we only consider these countries in the following}.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{../figs/raw_data.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption{\label{fig:rawdata}Data as provided by the John Hopkins
    university for some selected countries.}
\end{figure}

As the beginning of the epidemics is different in different countries
a direct comparison is difficult. Furthermore, especially the count of
cases is highly debated and plaqued with several uncertainties. Here,
we assume that the {\em death counts are reliable} and essentially
correct. Thus, in order to compare different countries we align all
curves such that day $0$ corresponds to the first day that the death
count reaches a specified threshold (either absolute or relative per
million inhabitants).

\begin{figure*}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{../figs/align_data.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption{\label{fig:aligndata} Case and death counts aligned to
    first day of more than a specified threshold (either absolute or
    relative per million inhabitants).}
\end{figure*}

\fig{aligndata} shows a clear data collapse, especially at higher
thresholds\footnote{Note that some countries might not have reached
  these higher thresholds and are therefore not included in every
  subplot.} -- which are less noisy -- of 100 (absolute) or 1 per
million (relative). Furthermore, it is evident that the current growth
rate of China, South Korea (which are very similar in relative terms)
and Japan is markedly slower than of the other countries. Especially,
the European countries appear quite similar and there is little (if
any) evidence that Germany reacted faster or better than Italy or
Spain.

Interestingly, also the case counts are somewhat aligned even though
day zero has been defined purely based on the death
counts. Furthermore, there appear to be two groups of countries with
different systematic delays between case and death counts. In
particular, Austria and Germany seem to report deaths consistently
later than France, Italy and Spain. This suggests that the
surprisingly low death rate reported for Austria and Germany could be
an artefact as reported numbers are simply some days older compared to
other countries! This {\em delay effect} makes comparing numbers from
different countries difficult and also leads to unreliable estimates
when naively comparing numbers from same days only. Similarly, judging
the effectiveness of containment measures, e.g. social distances,
requires time as well within the second week after the intervention
has been established a majority of observed cases had probably been
infected already before the intervention.

\subsection{Statistical modeling}

Besides the {\em case fatality rate} there are two major unknowns in
the current pandemic. Namely, the effective transmission or
reproduction rate of the virus and the fraction of observed
cases. Both are of major importantance in order to judge the state of
the pandemic, i.e. how much of the population is already infected, and
the effectiveness of mitigation measures such as {\em social
  distancing} that have been or are being implemented around the
globe. In particular, the future organization of social interactions
and restrictions relies on as accurate information as possible.

\paragraph{Epidemic model}
The basic SIR model \cite{Newman}, assumes that an infection unfolds when
susceptible (S) individuals become infected (I) -- which in turn
infect further susceptible individuals. Finally, infected individuals
recover (R) (or die) and are no longer susceptible. In continuous
time, the dynamics can be described by the following system of
ordinary differential equations (ODEs):
\begin{align*}
  \frac{dS}{dt} &= - \beta \frac{I_t}{N} S_t \\
  \frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta \frac{I_t}{N} S_t - \gamma I_t \\
  \frac{dR}{dt} &= \gamma I_t
\end{align*}
where $N \equiv S_t + I_t + R_t$ is constant over time. Model
parameters are
\begin{itemize}
\item the infection rate $\beta$
\item and the recovery rate $\gamma$.
\end{itemize}
In this model, the average time of infection is $\gamma^{-1}$ giving
rise to a {\em basic reproduction number} of $R_0 = \beta
\gamma^{-1}$.

SIR models and extensions are widely used in epidemic modeling. The
have also been applied to the understand the dynamics of the ongoing
Covid-19 pandemic
\cite{arxiv:2002.07572,arxiv:2004.01105,10.1126/science.abb3221,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028639v2}.
In particular, models including the possibility of unobserved cases or
including a reporting delay have been developed. Within the SIR
framework, both effects can be included in several ways, most easily
by assuming that observed cumulative infections are simply a fraction
$\alpha \in [0, 1]$ of previous total infections $I_t + R_t$,
i.e. $\alpha (I_{t - \tau} + R_{t - \tau})$. A more elaborate attempt
instead considers more detailed dynamics of the form
\begin{align*}
  \frac{dS}{dt} &= - \beta_I \frac{S_t}{N} I_t - \beta_O \frac{S_t}{N} O_t - \beta_U \frac{S_t}{N} U_t \\
  \frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta_I \frac{S_t}{N} I_t + \beta_O \frac{S_t}{N} O_t + \beta_U \frac{S_t}{N} U_t - \gamma_I I_t \\
  \frac{dO}{dt} &= \alpha \gamma_I I_t - \gamma_R O_t \\
  \frac{dU}{dt} &= (1 - \alpha) \gamma_I I_t - \gamma_R U_t \\
  \frac{dR}{dt} &= \gamma_R (O_t + U_t)
\end{align*}
where a fraction $\alpha$ of infected individuals $I_t$ is observed
($O_t$) after an initial delay $\frac{1}{\gamma_I}$. In any case,
whether observed or not, individuals recover (or die) after an
additional delay. In general, the infection rates $\beta_I, \beta_O,
\beta_U$ could be different for initial infections and observed vs
unobserved cases\footnote{An effective quarantine would be modeled via
  $\beta_O \equiv 0$.}.

In addition, mitigation measures, e.g. social distancing, can be
easily included by assuming that $\beta$'s are functions of
time. E.g. \cite{arxiv:2004.01105} assumes one or several (soft) step
functions where $\beta$ drops after measures have been
implemented. Unfortunately, as we show now a model including a
time-varying $\beta$ as well as unobserved cases is not identifiable.
For simplicity, consider the above model with $\beta_I = \beta_O =
\beta_U =: \beta$. Then, new infections arise with intensity $\beta
\frac{S_t}{N} (I_t + O_t + U_t)$ which in turn translate into observed
cases with intensity $\alpha \gamma_I I_t$. Now assume a second model
with $\alpha' = 1 > \alpha$. By using a time varying $\beta'(t)$
such that
\begin{align*}
  \beta'(t) &= \beta \frac{S_t}{S'_t}
\end{align*}
we obtain exactly the same number of observed cases $O_t$. Note that
as $\alpha' > \alpha$, we have that $S_t < S'_t$ and $S_t$ is a
sigmoidal function of time due to the SIR dynamics. Furthermore, when
the population is large, i.e. $N \gg 1$ and $S_0 \approx N$ the
resulting $\beta'(t)$ is mostly driven by the drop in $S_t$ as
compared to the much smaller change in $S'_t$. Indeed, \fig{SIRapprox}
shows the dynamics of the above model with $\beta = 0.3, \gamma_I =
\gamma_R = \frac{2}{10}$\footnote{Giving rise to an $R_0$ of $3$.} and
$\alpha = 0.1$ starting from $(N = 10^8, 1, 0, 0, 0)$. In turn, the
dynamics is approximated by the best-fitting logistic sigmoid scaling
$\beta'(t)$ and assuming $\alpha' = 1$. Note that the number of
observed cases is almost identical whereas the final fraction of
susceptible individuals is vastly different. Indeed, in the first case
the epidemic is stopped by group immunity whereas in the second case
effective mitigation measures are imposed. Correspondingly, police
implications would be vastly different in the two situations even
though they are observationally indistinguishable.

  \caption{\label{fig:SIRapprox} Total cumulative observed infections
    and number of susceptible individuals in two simulated model with
    observation fraction $\alpha = 0.1$ (true) and observation
    fraction $\alpha' = 1$ (approx). In the second model, the epidemic
    is stopped due to mitigation measures which are modeled via
    $\beta'(t)$ as explained in the main text.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Phenomenological growth model}
In order to build an identifiable model, we turn to a simpler
phenomenological description (compare \cite{kubinec} for a similar
approach). In particular, as sigmoidal growth provides a good
approximation to the SIR model dynamics we now directly model the
observed growth of reported cases and deaths. Furthermore, we use a
strong assumption to identify the model.

Overall, I believe it unlikely that the death rate is very different
across different countries\footnote{There are certainly demographic,
  medical or other aspects though.}. Thus, my phenomenological model
builds on the assumption that the {\em death rate is constant across
  all countries}\footnote{Note that this is not the case fatality rate
  which is commonly computed as the quotient of observed deaths and
  cases. Instead, the death rate applies to the actual, hidden number
  of cases and reveals itself in reported observations after the
  fact.} and differences purely arise from delays in reporting
positively tested cases and deaths. The model assumes the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The probability of death is the same for all countries whereas
  the testing prevalence is country specific.
\item Observed counts are negative binomial distributed -- as an
  over-dispersed Poisson -- and delayed wrt the actual cases.
\item Actual case and death counts in each country grow according to a
  sigmoid function -- as an approximation to an SIR type model -- with
  country specific parameters\footnote{The basic model assumes \[ c(t)
    = \frac{a}{1 + e^{- \beta (t - \tau)}} \; , \] i.e. the logistic
    function. Extensions using Gompertz or generalized logistic
    functions are also explored.}.
\end{itemize}

As shown in \fig{taudie}, this model\footnote{Full code of this and
  other models can be found at my accompanying
  \href{Github}{\url{https://github.com/bertschi/Covid}} repository.}
indeed finds a consistent difference in the delay of death counts
between Austria, Germany and France, Italy, Spain. Furthermore, the
death rate -- assumed constant across all countries -- is estimated as
$3.0 \pm {0.8 \atop 0.6} \%$. Estimates in the range of 3 to 5\%
appear to be rather robust for the present model, yet seem to be
somewhat high\footnote{Note that a naive estimation of the case
  fatality rate, i.e. dividing contemporal case by death counts is
  biased downwards by the delay effect as actual deaths only realize
  about a week after subjects had been tested positive. Accordingly
  the fatality rate estimate should be based on the substantially
  lower case counts a week ago.} given that the death rate applies to
the actual and not just the reported cases. It remains to be seen if my model
estimate holds up over time and wrt estimates derived from more
realistic models \ldots Yet, the assumption of a global death rate not
just allows to compare observed counts across countries, but also
identifies the model as all curves are scaled in the same absolute
fashion. Furthermore, jointly fitting the model on several countries
thereby pools information from observed case and death counts
explaining their differences purely as arising from different growth
dynamics and delays.

Detailed model predictions for all considered countries are shown in
\fig{modelpred}. The predictions are mostly reasonable, but the model
has difficulty of matching the rapid leveling off observed in China
and South Korea -- which has been shown to be rather well explained by
SIR type dynamics with effective quarantine
\cite{arxiv:2002.07572}. Interestingly, the model predicts that the
curve has already slowed markedly in Germany and Italy even though
this is barely visible in the raw numbers by now -- another example of
why the delay effect is important in understanding the dynamics of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, this model prediction relies heavily on the
assumption of sigmoidal growth and I would not be too optimistic about
it. Indeed, the predicted slow-down is less pronounced when assuming
Gompertz growth which has also been observed in
\cite{https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034595}. Yet, in terms of
leave-one-out likelihood the logistic model is preferred (not shown).

\section{Discussion}
Accurately understanding and modeling the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic is
crucial in order to establish effective and timely counter
measures. Yet, major quantities of interest are not known precisely
and especially delays of several weeks between first infection,
eventual symptoms and death make it particularly challenging to
quantify the effectiveness of social distancing. In turn, losening
restrictions prematurely could reestablish exponential spreading with
devstating consequences.

Here, I have shown that in SIR type models the fraction of reported
cases and effectiveness of social distancing cannot be estimated
jointly. Indeed, the model is strictly non-identifiable wrt these
parameters. In turn, I have developed a phenomenological model based
on sigmoidal growth dynamics. As the model does not strive to model
precise epidemic dynamics, longer term predictions should be
considered with care
\cite{https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034595}. Here, I only
provide nowcasts of actual case numbers which nevertheless provide a
look into several weeks of the future due the delay effect build into
the model. In particular, my main findings are that
\begin{itemize}
\item the death rate might be higher than commonly assumed. This is
  mainly driven by the rather long delay of 5 to 10 days between
  reported cases and eventual death.
\item the fraction of unobserved cases might be rather low and
  definitely does not exceed the reported case numbers tenfold as
  sometimes stated.
\end{itemize}
Both of these are bad news, as the epidemic could be worse than
commonly assumed. Furthermore, containment is challenging due to week
long incubation times
\cite{https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043109} but a conbination
of case tracing and isolation policies could be effective
\cite{fraser04,kubinec}. On the other hand, if most cases are actually
known effective policies can be implemented as evidenced in the
currently successful containment in China and South Korea. In the end,
data analysis alone only gets us only that far and more extensive
testing is urgently needed.

%% \section{Financial markets}

%% Especially the containment measures implemented in many countries
%% around the world, have major economic consequences. Non-essential
%% productive activity has come to a hold and financial markets around
%% the world tanked. Furthermore, uncertainty is high and the volatility
%% index VIX has reached levels as during the financial crisis of 2007/8.
%% \begin{marginfigure}

%%   \caption{Closing values of VIX.}
%% \end{marginfigure}

%% \subsection{Implied risk-neutral densities}

%% To get an impression of the forward-looking market outlook, I
%% investigate call and put options on the S\&P 500 index. In particular,
%% out- or slightly in-the-money options are actively traded and also
%% utilized in the computation of the VIX. \fig{optionchain} shows the
%% corresponding prices of call and put options for different expiration
%% dates.
%% \begin{marginfigure}
%%   \begin{center}
%%     \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{../figs/option_chain.pdf}
%%   \end{center}
%%   \caption{\label{fig:optionchain} Mid prices of call and put options
%%     on the S\&P 500. Only out- or slightly in-the-money options with
%%     positive bid price are shown. The grey line marks the current spot
%%     price.}
%% \end{marginfigure}

%% By risk-neutral pricing, the current value of an option on the
%% underlying $S_t$ paying $v(S_T)$ at maturity $T$ is given as
%% \[ p_t = \E^{\Q}[e^{- r (T - t)} v(S_T)] \; , \]
%% where the expectation is taken over the risk-neutral measure $\Q$. In
%% particular, assuming a log-normal risk-neutral distribution $q(s_T)$
%% the well known Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) formulas provides the
%% analytic price of European call and put options depending on the
%% risk-neutral interest rate $r$, maturity $T$, strike price $K$, spot
%% price $S_t$ and volatility $\sigma$. Unfortunately, the BSM has
%% several short-comings. Especially the assumption of constant
%% volatility does not hold in actual option prices giving rise to the
%% famous volatility-smile.

%% Nevertheless, the model is easily extended towards mixtures of
%% log-normal distributions. Then, by linearity of expectation values the
%% theoretical price is simply given as a weighted sum of BSM prices for
%% the different mixtures components. Here, we fit the above option
%% prices with a mixture of two components\footnote{Preliminary results
%%   show that more components only marginally improve the fit.}.
%% %% \begin{marginfigure}

%% %%     \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{../figs/model_loo.pdf}
%% %%   \end{center}
%% %%   \caption{Visual model comparison based on LOO log likelihood.}
%% %% \end{marginfigure}

%% Compared to a single component, the two component model is
%% substantially better and also nicely interpretable. In particular,
%% \fig{riskneutral} shows the implied components of the risk neutral
%% density. These can readily be interpreted as a good and bad market
%% outlook.
%% \begin{figure}

%%   \caption{\label{fig:riskneutral} Components of fitted implied
%%     risk-neutral density. Shown are 100 draws from the posterior
%%     distribution.}
%% \end{figure}
%% Indeed, \fig{crashprob} shows the implied crash probabilities,
%% i.e. weight assigned to the bad market component. These are
%% surprisingly high and even rise over longer maturities. In this sense,
%% option markets already price potentially long and large economic
%% distortions. Timely updates of this analysis will be provided and
%% hopefully the outlook will become more optimistic any time soon \ldots
